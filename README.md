# finalProject

##**Description**

<!-- My Final Project Idea is to use the Spotify API. Ideas/implementing only one of these:  -->
<!-- - Either give the top 20 music in realtime and let you play it.  -->
<!-- - Depending on the time of day it is (and people's mood changes), the music plays different playlists to fit that mood. -->
<!-- - Find a way to link certain songs/playlists with a certain piece of art. So you can look at pretty art whilst listening to music. -->

My Final Project will use the Spotify API to render a list of genres to the app. When you click on a genre, playlists will turn up. I plan to seed art work that I feel suites that genre. The idea is that you get to look at art work that suites that genre. The viewer will be able to scrawl through a list of art. 

##**User Stories**
1. Spotify API will be used
2. Viewer may have to log in to Spotify account once on page
3. A viewer will be able to search for a playlist by genre
4. When the viewer starts listening to a playlist, art pieces associated with that genre will come up on the screen
5. The viewer can click through the art pieces (using models and animation)
