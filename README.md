# WorldWide Spotify

##**Description**
My Final Project at General Assembly will be called WorldWide Spotify. The app will involve using the Spotify API to get hold of information. When viewers log into their spotify, they will be able to pick from a list of countries and be able to listen to the top playlists and new releases. I have learned that you need a spotify account/app for you to be able to play the music.  

##**User Stories**
1. Spotify API will be used
2. Viewer may have to log in to Spotify account once on page
3. If they do not have an account, I have a link bringing them to the website to sign up for one
3. A Viewer will be able to pick from a list of countries
4. When viewer clicks a country, the top categories/playlists and new releases in that country will show up
5. You can listen to music - through Spotify App
