# finalProject

**Basic Idea/Description**

My Final Project Idea is to use the Spotify API. Ideas/implementing only one of these: 
- Either give the top 20 music in realtime and let you play it. 
- Depending on the time of day it is (and people's mood changes), the music plays different playlists to fit that mood.
- Find a way to link certain songs/playlists with a certain piece of art. So you can look at pretty art whilst listening to music.

I hope to use:
- Node
- Angular
- Bootstrap or semantic
- JQUERY
- HTML
- CSS
- JSON to seed data
- Mongo
- Express
